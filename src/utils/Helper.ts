      "There is often a great deal of confusion regarding the protocols required by managed care companies for services provided. Unlike most traditional or indemnity insurance plans, managed care companies require a referral for a visit to the physician’s office and, additionally, pre-certification for a procedure that you may require. Some insurance companies provide the patient with a written referral for his/her visit and others simply give the patient a referral number. A referral does not provide a patient with the necessary approval to undergo a procedure; it simply means you have permission to visit a specialist for consultation and/or an office visit. It may be necessary to obtain authorization each and every time you visit this office. This rule varies depending on your insurance carrier.",
      "Most of the procedures performed in our New York City office require pre-certification. This means at the time of your consultation visit, you may have to return at another day or time for the recommended procedure when proper certification is obtained. Authorization and pre-certification varies from company to company. In many cases, pre-certification can be obtained by simply calling the insurance company. Some insurance companies, however, require written documentation for a procedure for review by a specialist, medical director, clerk or panel of varied professional and non-professional people. This can sometimes take one or two weeks. We are often asked to submit photographs and the number of treatments determined; once again the pre-certification is delayed. Our billing staff is experienced and well-trained in obtaining pre-certification and authorization. Please keep in mind that this process is time-consuming. It is often helpful for the patient to call his/her insurance company to help speed up the process.",

      "As part of our ongoing commitment to providing exceptional care, we want to ensure that your experience at our office is as smooth and efficient as possible. One important aspect of this is understanding the pre-certification process for certain medical procedures. Pre-certification is a standard requirement for many of the procedures we offer. This means that before undergoing a recommended procedure, it is often necessary to obtain proper certification from your insurance company. During your initial consultation visit, our medical team will discuss the proposed treatment plan with you. If pre-certification is required, you may be advised to return at a later date once the necessary approvals have been obtained. It's important to note that the authorization and pre-certification requirements can vary significantly.",
      "In some cases, additional information such as photographs and detailed treatment plans may be requested by the insurance company before pre-certification is granted. While this can potentially delay the process, please rest assured that our dedicated billing staff is highly experienced and well-trained to navigate these procedures efficiently on your behalf. To expedite the pre-certification process, we recommend that patients also take an active role by contacting their insurance companies directly. By proactively engaging with your insurer, you can help ensure timely approval and minimize any potential delays in scheduling your procedure. We understand that navigating the complexities of insurance requirements can be daunting, but please know that we are here to support you every step of the way. Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated as we work together to ensure the smooth processing of your medical needs.",
